The goal of this project is to build NearTweet, a microblogging service for crowds. From a user point of view,
 NearTweet consists of an application that users install on their mobile devices and enables them to share content
 within a crowd. Communication is possible either by relying on some server or by leveraging the devicesâ€™ closerange
 wireless capability to create a spontaneous network, over which users can broadcast messages. Spontaneous
 networks could form in relatively dense concentrations of people, both in open or closed spaces, such as stadiums,
 pavilions, malls, traffic jams, concerts, and restaurants. Although such gatherings are normally formed by
 anonymous and unrelated individuals, the context of the environment could prompt them to communicate with each
 other. For example, in a traffic jam, one could wish to ask the crowd why the traffic is stuck; in a canteen, poll the
 population for the best dish; in a concert, advertise events of his own band; and on a stadium, spread the word on
 some tickets left to be sold. NearTweet could support such use cases as well as many others of similar nature.
